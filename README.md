# Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project** repository!  
This project demonstrates how to design and build a modern data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold). It covers the full pipeline: from ingesting raw data to producing analytics-ready models.

---

##  Data Architecture

The data warehouse follows the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layered approach:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data exactly as received from source systems (ERP, CRM) in CSV format.  
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleansed and standardized data prepared for integration and analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Business-ready star schema with fact and dimension tables for reporting.

 Example architecture:  
`ERP/CRM CSV → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Analytics`

---

##  Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Data Architecture**: Implementing the Medallion Architecture.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Loading, cleaning, and transforming ERP and CRM data.  
- **Data Modeling**: Designing `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, and `fact_sales`.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Providing insights on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

 Skills demonstrated:  
- SQL Development  
- Data Modeling (Star Schema)  
- ETL Design (Bronze → Silver → Gold)  
- Data Analytics & Reporting

##  How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/data-warehouse-project.git
   ```

2. **Set up the database**  
   - Install SQL Server Express (or any SQL engine you prefer).  
   - Run scripts from `/scripts/bronze`, `/scripts/silver`, `/scripts/gold` in order.  

3. **Load datasets**  
   - Place ERP and CRM CSV files in `/datasets/`.  
   - Run ETL scripts to load them into the database.  

4. **Explore analytics**  
   - Query `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, and `fact_sales`.  
   - Build your own reports/dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, or SQL.
